# Random-Codes
The file contains three main codes, "hands_of_blue", "delete_range", and "peer_evals", all from an assignment from an introductory coding class. 

Here are some test cases for the codes, as an example of what to write. 
  
  hands_of_blue(["Bee", "Bee", "Puppycat", "Puppycat", "Deckard", "Deckard", "Cardamon", "Cardamon"])
 
  s = "I love the show Bee and Puppycat! My favorite character is most definitely Puppycat or Cardamon!"
  indices = [[7, 16], [59, 75], [83, 95]]
  delete_range(s, indices)

  peer_evals([[-1, 9, 6], [5, -1, 3], [10, 8, -1]])

Also, I actually have a error in my delete_ranges code, since it only deletes the first range, instead of all of the ranges. So if you wanna fix it, go ahead ;w; thanks
